### 10 Algorithms: Binary Search Part-2

| July, 15 |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Notes](/July15/Binary_Search_Problems.pdf) |  |
| 1.| Given a sorted array and an element X, check if the element is repeated. |
| 2.| Given a sorted array where every element is present twice except one element. Find the single occurring element. (Element is not given.) |
| 3.| Given an array of length n, where elements are sorted, all the elements are unique but one element is present twice, and the elements lie in the range [0, n-2]. Find the repeating element. |
| Home Work| What if instead of dividing the array into two parts, we start dividing the array into 3 parts. As (log3n < log2n) ? |

### 11 Doubt Solving

| --- | --- |
| Notes | XOR<br>N Queens<br>Subsequence Vs Subset |
| 1.  | Given a sorted rotated array, find the min element in less than O(n). |

### 12 Revision: Problem Solving Binary Search

| July, 18 |  |
| --- | --- |
| Notes |  |
| 1. | Find three unique set(s) having an equal sum. |
| 2. | In an array find a pair with a given sum |
| 3. | Total Triplets |
| Home Work | H/W gave on Jul 15: <br><br>Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to divide your search space into 3 parts (Ternary Search)?<br><br>Dividing it into 2 parts makes sense because it gives you less number of comparisons, but, How many comparisons?<br><br>If we divide merge sort into 3 subarrays instead of 2, How many comparisons will increase? Calculate the factor by which it will increase. |
