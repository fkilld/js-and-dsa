Q1: Take as input N, a number. Print odd numbers in decreasing sequence (up until 0) and even numbers in increasing sequence (up until N). E.g. for N = 6 print 5 3 1 2 4

Q2: Write a program to calculate the sum of all natural numbers till n using recursion.

Input1: n = 5

Output1: 15

Input2: n = 1

Output2: 1

Q3: Take as input N, a number. N is the size of a snakes and ladder board (without any snakes and ladders). Take as input M, a number. M is the number of faces of the dice. a. Write a recursive function which returns the count of different ways the board can be travelled using the dice. Print the value returned. b. Write a recursive function which returns an Array of dice values for all valid paths across the board. Print the value returned. e.g. for a board of size 10 and dice size 6, a few valid paths will be “64”, “46”, “2332”, “541” etc.
